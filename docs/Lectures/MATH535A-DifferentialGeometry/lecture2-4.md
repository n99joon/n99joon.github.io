### Differentiable structure $F$ of class $C^k (1 \le k \le \infty)$  
Differentiable structure $F$ of class $C^k (1 \le k \le \infty)$ on a locally Euclidean space $M$ is a collection of coordinate systems ${U_{\alpha}, \phi_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A}$ satisfying three properties  

#### Second - Countable  
In topology, a topological space is said to be second countable if its topology has a countable base. A base for a topology is a collection of open sets such that every open set in the topology can be written as a union of elements of the base.
