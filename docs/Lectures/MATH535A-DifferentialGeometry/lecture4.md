### Locally Compact  
Each point has at least one compact neighborhood

#### Compact  
Every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover.  
An open cover is a collection of open sets whose union contains $K$.  
A finite subcover means that we can select finitely many sets from the cover to still completely contain $K$.

#### Compact Neighborhood
A compact neighborhood of a point $p$ in a topological space is a set $V$ that satisfies the following:

$V$ is compact as a subset of the topological space. That means every open cover of $V$ has a finite subcover.

$V$ is a neighborhood of $p$, meaning there exists an open set $U$ such that:
$$
p \in U \subseteq V.
$$

### Paracompact
A topological space is paracompact if every open cover has an open locally finite refinement

### Refinement 

### Lemma: If locally compact & Hausdorff & second countable, then paracompact
**Proof:**
